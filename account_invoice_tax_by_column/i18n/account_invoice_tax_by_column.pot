"            openerp by default calculates taxes line by line as a function of line tax base amount \n"

"            TA(l) = f(TBA(l)\n"
"            TA(t) = sum( round( TA(l) ) )    /sum on lines l to which tax t is applied\n"
"        this module behaviour: \n"
"            In Italy the correct way to compute taxes is to first compute the tax base amount TBA(t) \n"
"            and the compute TA as a function of TBA(t)\n"
"            TBA(t) = sum( TBA(t) )    /sum on lines l to which tax t is applied\n"

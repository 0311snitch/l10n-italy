Period End VAT Statement
========================

This module helps to register the VAT statement of period end.

In order to load correct amount from tax, the tax has to be
associated to account involved in statement, through tax form.

The 'VAT statement' object allows to specify every amount and relative account
used by the statement.
By default, amounts of debit and credit taxes are automatically loaded
from taxes of the selected periods.
Previous debit or credit is loaded from previous VAT statement, according
to its payments status.
Confirming the statement, the 'account.move' is created. If you select
a payment term, the due date(s) will be set.

The 'tax authority' tab contains information about payment(s).
You can see statement's result ('authority VAT amount') and residual
amount to pay ('Balance').
The statement can be paid like every other debit, by 'move.line'
reconciliation.

If you need to calculate interest, you can add default information in your
company data (percentage and account).
